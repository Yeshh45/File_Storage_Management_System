### File Storage Management System (C Application)

## Project Description

The **File Storage Management System** is an enterprise-level C application designed to handle large-scale file and directory operations efficiently. This system allows users to create, retrieve, and delete files while ensuring optimal storage space utilization and secure file handling. Key features include real-time file updates, version control, and support for concurrent file access by multiple users. The project uses advanced data structures like binary trees and hash tables for efficient organization, and POSIX threads for managing multiple simultaneous file operations.

## Features
- **Create, Read, Delete Files**: Basic file management operations.
- **Concurrency**: Multiple users can access the system concurrently, thanks to POSIX Threads.
- **Optimized Data Structures**: Efficient storage using data structures like binary trees and hash tables.
- **Memory Management**: Careful use of dynamic memory allocation and error handling.
- **Thread Safety**: Implemented using mutex locks to ensure safe concurrent access to shared resources.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: C
- **Data Structures**: Binary Trees, Hash Tables
- **Concurrency**: POSIX Threads
- **File I/O**: C Standard Library Functions (`fopen`, `fwrite`, `fread`, etc.)
- **System Calls**: Linux System Calls
- **Build Tools**: Makefile

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file_storage_management_system.git
cd file_storage_management_system
```

### 2. Build the Project
Use the provided `Makefile` to compile the code.

```bash
make
```

### 3. Run the Application
After building the project, run the executable:

```bash
./file_storage
```

## Usage

### 1. Creating a File
You can create a file by calling the `create_file` function in the main program:

```c
create_file("example.txt", "This is a sample file.");
```

### 2. Reading a File
Retrieve the content of an existing file using the `read_file` function:

```c
read_file("example.txt");
```

### 3. Deleting a File
Delete a file by calling the `delete_file` function:

```c
delete_file("example.txt");
```

### 4. Thread Safety
The system ensures that file operations are thread-safe. You can run file operations concurrently from different threads.

## Future Enhancements
- **Version Control**: Adding support for versioning of files.
- **Directory Management**: Expand the system to manage directories as well as individual files.
- **Distributed Storage**: Implement a distributed version of the file storage system.
- **File Encryption**: Secure file content with encryption methods for enhanced security.
